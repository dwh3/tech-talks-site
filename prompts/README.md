# Prompt Skeletons

This folder stores starter metaprompts for Codex workflows. Each file is a skeleton template that will be expanded with detailed guidance later.

Refer to [AGENT.md](../AGENT.md) for the full workflow context and operating rules.

## Usage
- `PLAN_PROMPT.md`: use when Codex must analyze the repo and return planning bullets without editing files.
- `IMPLEMENT_PROMPT.md`: use when executing a single approved plan bullet with code, tests, docs, and verification commands.
- See the Modes section in [AGENT.md](../AGENT.md#operating-modes) for complete requirements.
