# Content Model

## Talks Schema
- `title` (string) - session name.
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `time` with `timezone`.
- `duration` (minutes, optional for past entries).
- `slug` (string) - stable URL fragment.
- `speakers` (list) with `name`, `bio`, optional `avatar`.
- `topics` and `tags` (string lists) for navigation.
- `status` (string) to indicate scheduling state.
- `abstract` (string) and `outline` (list) for descriptions.
- `resources` (map) for links such as slides, agenda, repo.
- `thumbnail` and `recording_url` (strings, past talks only).

## Storage
- Source YAML: `/data/schedule.yml` with `upcoming`, `past`, and summary `stats`.
- Rendered via MkDocs macros and templates in `/docs`.

## Resources Mapping
- `slides`: `hooks.py` injects a "Slides" link on autogenerated talk detail pages when present.
- `agenda`: `hooks.py` adds an "Agenda" link on autogenerated talk detail pages for sessions that include it.
- `repo`/`repo_url`: `hooks.py` exposes a "Repo" link; macro past index only flags "Resources available" without deep linking.
- Other keys: title-cased links on autogenerated talk pages; not surfaced elsewhere today.
