# Website Improvement Roadmap

This page outlines suggested improvements to make our biweekly Tech Talks site more engaging, user-friendly, and valuable for the team. Items are listed in order of potential impact.

---

## 1. Dynamic Homepage Dashboard (Most Impactful)
Transform the static homepage into an engaging dashboard.  
- Show **Next Talk** with countdown timer, speaker bio, and key topics.  
- Add a **Recent Talks** carousel with 3–4 past sessions (thumbnails, titles).  
- Include quick stats (total talks delivered, upcoming speakers, popular topics) to communicate community momentum.  

---

## 2. Resource Library with Smart Categorization
Build a searchable, filterable archive of past talks.  
- Tag sessions by **level** (beginner/intermediate/advanced), **tech stack** (Python, SQL, ML frameworks), and **domain** (analytics, engineering, research).  
- Bundle talk resources (slides, notebooks, recordings) into a single download package.  
- Create **learning paths** that group related talks into sequences for structured development.  

---

## 3. Interactive Pre- and Post-Talk Engagement
Enhance each talk page with features before and after the session.  
- Add **Questions & Prerequisites** so participants can submit questions in advance and see suggested readings.  
- Include a **Key Takeaways** section with community-contributed notes, related internal projects, and “try it yourself” challenges.  

---

## 4. Improve Navigation & Consistency
Refine the overall site structure and standardization.  
- Add persistent navigation (e.g., *Home*, *Upcoming Talks*, *Past Talks*, *Resources*, *Propose a Talk*).  
- Standardize talk pages with consistent sections: **title, speaker, abstract, outline, resources, recording**.  

---

## 5. Lower Barriers for Contribution (Least Impactful but Valuable)
Make it easier for team members to propose and contribute.  
- Provide a lightweight submission form for talk ideas and feedback (instead of only PRs).  
- Recognize contributors by highlighting names on schedule or talk pages.
