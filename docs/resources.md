# Resources

Explore materials from our Learning & Development program. We keep links to slides, notebooks, demo code, and recordings on each talk page.

- Browse the [Past Talks](talks/index.md) for session-specific assets.
- Want to contribute new material? Open a pull request adding links to the talk entry in `data/schedule.yml`, or drop a note in the [suggestion form](suggest.md).
- Looking for program improvements? See the draft ideas in [Website Improvement Roadmap](improvements.md).

More sections will be added as the library grows.
